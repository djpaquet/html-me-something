     <div><h2>Early Days</h2>
        <p>When I first saw Milo at the Human Society I should of 
            known right then he would be trouble, but he was so cute I 
            just couldn't leave without him. There he was in his little kennel, jumping and barking 
            like a litte maniac. 'I want <em>that</em> one!' I said to 
            myself. He's been a handful ever since!</p><br />

        <p>I adopted Milo in March 2017, he was 5 months 10lbs 
            and scrappy!</p>

         <h2>Milo Does What Milo Wants</h2>
         <p>When Milo wants something he does not keep it a secret. Even after going through
             The Butt Sniffers Academy at <a href="https://thewateringbowl.com">The Watering Bowl</a>, Milo still
             feels like the rules don't apply to him.<br /><br />

             <br /><br />
             Some of his favorite things are:
             <ul>
                 <li>Treats</li>
                 <li>Carrots</li>
                 <li>Pizza crusts</li>
                 <li>Causing a ruckus</li>
             </ul>
             Milo loves to play <strong>all the time</strong>! He espicially loves to
             play with his cousin Loki.<br /><br />

         <h2>Can't Have Nice Things</h2>
         <p>Milo is the the Master of Distruction! He has chewed several shoes, broken a laptop,
             eaten several remotes. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Also I will say that there
             is no such thing as a indistructible toy, no matter what the package says! 
         </p>

         <p>He also seems to hate every dog bed I buy him. They will end up destuffed and shredded 
             in no time.

         <h2>He's Cute & He Knows It</h2>
         <p>I have to admit that I might be partially be to blame for Milo's behaivor. He's just so cute 
             and I've spoiled him rotten!<br />
            Just look at his little face though! Can you blame me?

         <p>All in all I must say even I am so happy I brought this little rascal home and couldn't imagine life
             without him. If you're thinking about getting your own little scamp to love I suggest checking out your
